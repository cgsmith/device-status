# Device Status

Ping checker to run on a Raspberry Pi. Needed to run a status check while troubleshooting nodes on a large network. This was an easy way to push out a message when the device went down or up without setting up SNMP or anything too fancy.

I supposed this is fancy though....


Required: 

`pip install postmarker`
